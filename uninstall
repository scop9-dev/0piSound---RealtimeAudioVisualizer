## Uninstall / Removal

0piSound does not perform any permanent changes to your system by default.  
However, if the **“Auto Start”** option in the settings was enabled at least once, the program creates a registry key to launch automatically at startup.

To fully remove 0piSound from your system:

1. **Delete the registry key** (if Auto Start was enabled)  

2. **Remove the settings folder**  
   - Delete the folder `0piSound` located in:  

     %AppData%\Roaming\

   - This folder stores all configuration and user preferences.

> After completing these steps, 0piSound and its settings will be fully removed from your system.

You can use the provided `.bat` file in the repository for automatic removal.
